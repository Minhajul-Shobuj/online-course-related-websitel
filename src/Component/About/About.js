                <h2>3. Take Notes With Pen & Paper</h2>
                <p>While it’s faster to take notes on a laptop or mobile during the session, using a pen & paper will help you learn and comprehend better. Researches confirmed that although taking notes by hand is slower and more cumbersome than typing on a computer or mobile, the act of writing out the information fosters comprehension and retention.</p>

                <h2>4. Engage With Your Teacher & Ask Questions</h2>
                <p>Although we should listen twice more than we speak. Still, speaking and asking questions is a very important part of meaningful learning. Accordingly, you should listen to your teacher but also engage with him/her and ask all questions and inquiries you have in mind to better understand your lessons.</p>

                <h2>5. Learn Through Short Bursts Of Time</h2>
                <p>It has been proven that learning through short-sessions is much better than longer-sessions. The ideal single session duration is 30 – 60 minutes. In other words, while 30 minutes is the minimum time to get a proper amount of knowledge and save it to memory, more than 60 minutes is considered too much information for your brain can take in at one time.</p>

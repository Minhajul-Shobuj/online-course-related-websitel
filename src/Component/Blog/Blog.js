            <h1> Benefits of Reciting the Quran</h1>
            <p>As stated, the Quran was revealed in the month of Ramadan. But how was it revealed to our Prophet Muhammad s.a.w for the first time and what are the first few verses that were revealed to him?

                Well, it all started when Prophet Muhammad s.a.w was sitting in the cave of Hira’ on a mountain called The Mountain of Light also known as ‘Jabal Nur’. As Prophet Muhammad s.a.w felt restless and helpless with the decadence of the Meccan Quraisy, the Prophet s.a.w found peace and solace during his seclusion in the cave of Hira’. Little did he know that one of the days of his stay in the cave, that Angel Jibril a.s. would visit him. </p>
            <div>
                <p>But what happened when Jibril came to meet the Prophet Muhammad s.a.w?

                    In a hadith reported by Sayyidatina Aisyah r.a. and narrated by Imam Al-Bukhari,

                    “..The angel came to him and asked him to read. The Prophet s.a.w replied, "I do not know how to read.’’ The Prophet s.a.w added, "The angel caught me (forcefully) and pressed me so hard that I could not bear it anymore. He then released me and again asked me to read and I replied, 'I do not know how to read.”Thereupon he caught me again and pressed me a second time till I could not bear it anymore. He then released me and again asked me to read but again I replied, “I do not know how to read !?” Thereupon he caught me for the third time and pressed me, and then released me and said,"

                    "Read in the name of your Lord, who has created (all that exists), created man from a clot. Read! And your Lord is the Most Generous.”

                    (Surah Al-'Alaq, 96:1-5)</p>
                <p>The first revelation that Allah s.w.t. revealed to Prophet Muhammad s.a.w was the commandment for his people to seek knowledge, through the spirit of Iqra’ (reading). This set the foundational basis of the Prophetic message to humanity. The importance of knowledge is clearly expounded by the Prophet. This promotion of knowledge for all humankind had enlightened humanity from the ignorance of the Dark Ages.

                <h2>1. You will get rewarded for every letter that you read from the Quran.</h2>
                <p>Yes! You read it right, not 1 surah, not 1 ayat, not 1 word, but you will be rewarded for each letter that is recited from the verses of the Quran.

                    Sayyidatina Aishah r.a reported:
                    Whoever recites a letter from Allah's Book, then he receives the reward from it, and the reward of ten the like of it. I do not say that Alif Lam Mim is a letter, but Alif is a letter, Lam is a letter and Mim is a letter

                <h2>2. Quran Calms the Soul.</h2>
                <p>Reciting the Quran is part of remembrance (zikir). It is also a form of Ibadah. When you do zikir, you will attain inner peace and solace as mentioned in the Quran:
                    “Those who have believed and whose hearts are assured by the remembrance of Allah. Unquestionably, by the remembrance of Allah, hearts are assured”

                    (Surah Ar-Ra’ad, 13:28)

                <h2>3. You stutter and can't get it right? No problem. You will be rewarded for that too!
                </h2>
                <p>For some of us, the Arabic language is a foreign language. When you are a beginner, you tend to stutter and may find it difficult to read it fluently. Not understanding what you are reading is already frustrating enough, what more to practice to read in different language and letters.

                    But fear not, Allah s.w.t. is All-Knowing, Most Merciful. He will reward you twice for the hard work of trying to read the verses of the Quran!

                    Sayidatina Aishah (r.a.) reported:
                    "The one who is proficient in the recitation of the Qur'an will be with the honourable and obedient scribes (angels), and he who recites the Qur'an and finds it difficult to recite, doing his best to recite it in the best way possible, will have two rewards."

                    (Sahih Al-Bukhari & Muslim)</p>

                <h2>4. Quran is a Source of Guidance</h2>
                <p>As a human being, we constantly need someone to talk and to share our problems. While making dua is one of the means to talk to Allah, you can also find answers while reading the Quran. It is one of the ways how Allah communicates with us. He sent down guidance for us 1400 years ago! Allah s.w.t. mentioned in the Quran in a couple of Surahs:
                    “A Book We have sent down to you so that you may bring forth mankind from the darkness into the light..”.

                    (Surah Ibrahim, 14:1)

                    Read the Quran and you will be amazed how it speaks and comforts you and that the answers to your worries may just be in between the lines. Remember, when reciting the Quran, do ensure to find the right source of interpretations and get clarifications from certified Asatizah as well.

                <h2>5. The Quran is made easy for us.</h2>
                <p>To this, Allah s.w.t. says in the Quran:
                    And We have certainly made the Quran easy for remembrance, so is there any who will remember?

                    (Surah Al-Qamar,  54:17)
                    Allah s.w.t, the Most Merciful mentioned in the Quran four times specifically in Surah Al-Qamar, that He had made it easy for us to recite and comprehend, to remind mankind that regardless of who we are, we are constantly in need of reminders from Him. Allah s.w.t. mentioned in Surah As-Sad:
                    [This is] a blessed Book which We have revealed to you, [Oh Muhammad], that they might reflect upon its verses and that those of understanding would be reminded

                    (Surah Sad 38:29)
